#Changelog
All notable major changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 18/08/2018
### Added
- All the User Interface functions that will be needed in the program.
- Designed the basic structure of the program (code)
- Wrote pseudo code for the program.
- configureGameUI()

### Still working on
- configureGameUI(): Number of <div> tags and paragraphs required.
- Game layout
- Code to test character typed

### Summary of this week
Major pseudocode has been written but cannot find anything good algorithm for character typed testing over
the internet related to the typing game. 'ui.js' and configureGameUI() have been added to the program.

## 03/09/2018
### Added
- Added generateNewWord() function
- setInterval() function for the timer
- Researched about how to check key pressed by the user
- The checkKey() function was inspired from (https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/122053/typing-game-in-javascript)

### Still working on-
- setInterval function
- Game layout
- Load data from 'data.js' object

### Summary of this week
Struggled a lot to create generateNewWord() function as it was throwing some sort of error on each step. Tracked them down using
'console.log' after each line. setInterval() was also not working as expected, levels were changing too fast and unexpectedly. Researched
on google and found setTimeout() is better to use.

## 08/09/2018
### Added
- 'score' and 'time' spans and paragraphs
- countdown()
- updateLevel()
- data for levels

### Changed
- 'ids' are changed to 'classes' for all <div> elements

### Still working on-
- Game layout
- adding data for 'hard' and 'medium' levels
- checkKey() function

### Summary of this week
The major problem faced this week was adding a lot of random data into the data file. Found a wonderful website which
does exactly this. (generatedata.com) Used '.csv' random generator and then generated random strings.

## 13-09-2018
### Added
- Buttons for 'next level'
- updateLevel1(), updateLevel2(), updateLevel3(), updateLevel4(), updateLevel5()
- addEventListener() added and tested many times
- startGameButtonHandler(level)
- levelButtonHandler()
- createDifficultyMenu()

### Changed
- Rather than typing 'score' in a <span> tag, it is written as a paragraph

### Still working on-
- Game layout
- Button for difficulty menu
- Animating the text in gameplay

### Summary of this week
Created 6 major levels this week based on time. Combining it with 3 levels of difficulty, there will be a total of 24 levels
in the game. All the button handlers were also added in the code and tested. Next week I want to create a main menu
and then proceed from there.

## 16-09-2018
### Added
- Button for starting game
- createMainMenu()
- Buttons for instructions
- Button for 'back to main menu'

### Changed
- Rather than calling configureGameUI() in loadApplication(), it is called from levelButtonHandler()

### Still working on-
- Increasing responsiveness of the game play page
- checkKey() function
- Understanding 'String.fromCharCode()'

### Summary of this week
Main menu was created without much hassle. Creating 'back to main menu' button is important for the game as this will enable User
to return to the main screen anytime between the game. All the major code for the app is ready, all that is needed now is
a great CSS and sound.

## 18-09-2018
### Added
- soundtrack
- sound to play on each button click
- background image
- Major CSS
- @media tags for making it work in landscape mode in iPhone X

### Changed
- instructions inside loadInstruction()
- Play background music not from the start, but only when the user clicks on Difficulty level.

### Still working on-
- CSS colours and animations
- improving button style
- Improving timer menu

### Summary of this week
Founding a open source good soundtrack was critical as it enhances the user experience Had to find a way to set
property for changing 'opaque' property of background image as there is no such property in HTML for this purpose.
Changed a lot of game layout when the game is played in
landscape mode.
