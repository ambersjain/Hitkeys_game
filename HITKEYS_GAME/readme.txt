API reference : checkKey(), generateNewWord() and loadNextWord() are major functions which can be reused again and again. "generateNewWord()" can
generate any random word from a given set of words inside an object/array. Then it can split the word and store each character into an array.
The checkKey() can then analyse each character and match with typed character.
